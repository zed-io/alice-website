Some web browsers (includingSafari, Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Chrome) incorporate a “Do Not Track” (DNT) orsimilar feature that signals to websites that a visitor does not want to have his/her onlineactivity and behavior tracked. If an online service elects to respond to a particular DNTsignal, the service may refrain from collecting certain personal information about thebrowser’s user. Not all browsers offer a DNT option and there is currently no industryconsensus as to what constitutes a DNT signal. For these reasons, many websiteoperators, including Alice Wallet, do not take action to respond to DNT signals. For moreinformation about DNT signals, visit http://allaboutdnt.com. <br><br>‍<strong>CHANGES AND UPDATES TO PRIVACY POLICY</strong> <br><br>We reserve the right to update and revise this privacy policy at any time.
